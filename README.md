# Computer Vision

Welcome to my repository for computer vision projects. This collection of small projects demonstrates my practical experience and skills in computer vision. These projects serve as valuable additions to my profile, showcasing my abilities in the field of computer vision.

## Project 1: Hand Tracking

### Overview
The "Hand Tracking" project is designed to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam. It makes use of the MediaPipe library, and it displays the positions of hand landmarks along with the frame's frames per second (FPS).

### Project Code
You can find the code for this project in the hand-tracking folder.

#### Project Dependencies
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe (mediapipe)

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `HandTracking.py` script.
3. The webcam feed will open, and the script will start detecting and tracking hands.

### Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Visualization of hand landmarks.
- Display of frames per second (FPS).
- Simple key event listener to exit the application using the 'q' key.
